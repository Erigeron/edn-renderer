# edn-renderer

`edn-renderer` is the browser frontend for the `edn-relay` workflow.

It keeps a websocket connection to the relay, subscribes to a chosen channel
such as `genui`, stores the incoming Cirru EDN layout DSL, renders the layout,
and sends an ack back to the CLI.

The sidebar is collapsed by default so more horizontal space is reserved for the
rendered result.

## Current Status

The current implementation already supports the full loop:

1. start `edn-relay serve`
2. open `edn-renderer` in a browser
3. run `edn-relay send --channel genui <LAYOUT>` from the CLI
4. render the DSL in the page
5. confirm success with a returned ack payload and layout id

## Development

```bash
corepack enable && corepack prepare yarn@4.12.0 --activate
yarn install

cr js
yarn vite --host 127.0.0.1 --port 3010
```

Published bootstrap page:

- `https://r.tiye.me/Erigeron/edn-renderer/`
- supports `?channel=<NAME>` to preselect a channel
- supports `?server=<WS_URL>` or `?port=<PORT>` to override the relay websocket target

If Vite fails because `rolldown` native bindings are missing, run `yarn install`
again so the unplugged package is materialized on disk.

## End-to-End Usage

Start the frontend dev server:

```bash
yarn vite --host 127.0.0.1 --port 3010
```

Open the page in a browser. In parallel, run the relay:

```bash
edn-relay serve
```

If you want the published bootstrap page instead of a local dev server, run:

```bash
edn-relay open-published --channel genui
```

Then send a layout DSL from the CLI:

```bash
LAYOUT=$(cat <<'EOF'
{}
	:type |card
	:text "|CLI Demo"
	:children $ []
		{} (:type |badge) (:text |preview)
		{} (:type |divider)
		{} (:type |text) (:text "|Hello from installed CLI")
		{} (:type |row)
			:children $ []
				{} (:type |button) (:text |Confirm)
				{} (:type |input) (:name |email) (:placeholder |Email)
EOF
)

edn-relay send --channel genui "$LAYOUT"
```

Expected result:

- CLI prints an `ack` frame whose payload contains `:status |ok` and `:layout_id`
- the page shows the layout id and request id
- the renderer preview updates immediately

## DSL Components

Current built-in nodes:

- `column`
- `row`
- `card`
- `text`
- `badge`
- `divider`
- `markdown`
- `mermaid`
- `chart`
- `button`
- `input`

Detailed DSL rules and examples live in [COMPONENTS.md](COMPONENTS.md).

Current analysis-oriented rendering behavior:

- `markdown` renders headings, bullets, quotes, and wrapped paragraphs
- `mermaid` renders a Mermaid SVG diagram from the provided source text
- `chart` renders a compact horizontal bar chart from `:series`

## Validation

Compile the Calcit app with:

```bash
cr js
```

For isolated browser validation, use the `chrome-devtools` workflow described in
[Agents.md](Agents.md).
